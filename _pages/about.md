Hi! I'm Dilip Venkatesh, a project associate at [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in/) at IIT Madras, where I'm advised by [Dr. Anoop Kunchukuttan](https://anoopk.in/) and [Dr. Raj Dabre](https://prajdabre.github.io/) on multilingual NLP.

My research interests include alignment of large language models and mechanistic interpretability them.
